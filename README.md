 calculator project w/Typescript

 live preview @ https://odinproject-calculator.pages.dev/ 

 The project was completed with the help of a tutorial, as some of the calculator requirements were beyond my scope of knowledge. I replaced the Div Elements with Semantic Html and changed the CSS to style the calculator differently. 
 
 I also renamed some of the Javascript Variables, to be more descriptive and refactored the switch statements to if else statements with The logical OR operator.I also took the opportunity to convert the project from Javascript to Typescript.
